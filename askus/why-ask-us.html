            <h1>Why AskUs?</h1>
            <p class="text1">Our page was born as a resource to obtain answers, points of view and data on the revelations given throughout history as support for the questions asked by our visitors. With respect to Religion, controversies are always generated by the things that are believed, the things that are said, and the things as they really are.<br>
            Through this space, we intend to give a clear answer to almost any question you have regarding the Revealed Doctrine of the true Gospel of Jesus Christ. You will find detailed documentation and scripture quotes that will support the answers. Videos of the leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, notes, writings, themes, images, and any evidence that can help clarify the different questions.<br> 
            We invite our visitors to turn to the true source of all answers, through prayer, asking the Heavenly Father to give us the security within us of the answers we can find.<br>
            One of the Revealed Scriptures, called the Doctrine and Covenants, in section 88, verse 118 quotes: “…Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; Seek knowledge, both by study and by faith.” So then, we intend with total sincerity, that God can enlighten our understanding, and as He promises in the Old Testament, in the book of Malachi 3:10: "... Try me now in this... if I will not open the windows of heaven..." with light, which is truth and clarity.<br>
