      <h3>Why Ask Us?</h3>
      <p>
        Our page was born as a resource to obtain answers, points of view and data on the revelations given throughout history as support for the questions asked by our visitors.
        With respect to Religion, controversies are always generated by the things that are believed, the things that are said, and the things as they really are. Through this space, we intend to give a clear answer to almost any question you have regarding the Revealed Doctrine of the true Gospel of Jesus Christ.
        You will find detailed documentation and scripture quotes that will support the answers. Videos of the leaders of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, notes, writings, themes, images, and any evidence that can help clarify the different questions. We invite our visitors to turn to the true source of all answers, through prayer, asking the Heavenly Father to give us the security within us of the answers we can find.
        One of the Revealed Scriptures, called the Doctrine and Covenants, in section 88, verse 118 quotes: “…Seek ye out of the best books words of wisdom; Seek knowledge, both by study and by faith.” So then, we intend with total sincerity, that God can enlighten our understanding, and as He promises in the Old Testament, in the book of Malachi 3:10: "... Try me now in this... if I will not open the windows of heaven..." with light, which is truth and clarity.

      <h3>About Us</h3>
      <p>
        We are a group of members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, who began to meet with the objective of discussing certain frequently asked questions that some people have regarding Jesus Christ, the Creation, and the premortal life, among others. Other themes.
        With the aim of allowing people to find the answer to many questions in a documented way, we decided to organize a place to archive our contributions, our study, and all the research we can carry out.
        The Holy Bible assures us that “The Spirit of Truth will guide us into all truth” (John 16:13). Is it that we already know all the truth? Or is it that we reject the guidance of the Holy Spirit?
        We do not seek to divide, but rather the unity of all men under the only lineage that unites us, and we do not want to generate any kind of hatred or resentment for our beliefs, highlighting two of the principles in which we believe, by highlighting the respect we feel by Revelation when we teach that “We believe all that God has revealed, all that he presently reveals, and we believe will yet reveal many great and important matters pertaining to the Kingdom of God” (Art. of Faith: 9), and in respect towards the beliefs of others by proclaiming that "We claim the right to worship Almighty God according to the dictates of our own conscience, and grant to all men the same privilege: Let them worship how, where, or what they please" (Art. of faith: 11).
