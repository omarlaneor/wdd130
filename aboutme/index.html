    <h2>Omar Junior Osorio</h2>
    <p>People used to call me only "Omar", but I don't dislike my second name "Junior".</p>
    <p>I'm coursing an Applied Technology BS, and I'm really enjoying it.
        I love singing, reading books and listening to music. I was a dancer for a small group
        that me and my brother started in 1998. We used to be know here in the place I live as Raizel.
        It was a very exciting time. Then, I started studying at the University a degree called Lic. Modern Languages.
        Unfortunately, I couldn't finish because of some personal troubles.
    <p>I'm married. I knew my wife 17 years ago. We were sweethearts like 7 years (hehehehe). I was following the
        Jacob's example. Well, that's what I said to my girlfriend at that time. We got married 10 years ago, and we
        have an extraordinary little girl who is 6. I have a boy who is 19, but that's another history. I baptized him
        and I had the chance to make some Priesthood ordinances with him. Now, he lives in Bogot√°, the capital, and
        is studying at the University too.
    <p>I'm member of the Church since I was 8. And my favorite quote is from Elder David Bednar, who said:
        "You (talking to us) believe in God, but you don't believe in what He Says". He pronounced that in a Pathway
        Connect's conference in 2018. I really loved it.
    <p>I know this Gospel is true. My Savior Loves us, in everytime, everywhere. This is an inspired program, and I know
        everything we can learn is guided by the Holy Ghost, in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.
