                    <p class="text1">Let your soul be filled with pure nature, where the rugged but simple terrain will allow you to enjoy thousands of beautiful landscapes. Canyon walls adorn this wonderful escape, which in turn will fill your lungs with fresh air.<br>

                    The Salm√≥n River has wonderful white sands on its beaches along with the beautiful currents of its rapids, and how not to mention the more than 200 species of birds that can be seen along the route. Beautiful wild animals that reign in this environment protected and preserved by mother nature. The Bura deer, Black Bears, River Otters, among others, will make you not stop shooting the flash of your camera.<br>
                        
                    The Rocky Mountains present us with this beautiful wildlife scene in its purest essence. The fluvial meeting of the Snake and Salmon rivers offers the most relaxing opportunity of the trip with its fishing, but at the same time, the resounding union of these deep specimens is worth admiring.<br>

                    <p class="text2">The ghosts of Butch Cassidy and his Hole-In-The-Wall gang didn't hide out in the canyon's beautiful but isolated landscape for no reason, for despite it being remote and nearly inaccessible, the boating is amazing! The history of this beautiful place tells itself. Petroglyphs of the ancient Native Americans, the abandoned farms like ghost town of the old west. All in one place.<br>

                    Beautiful sandy beaches, crystal clear streams, exotic animals and a great variety of vegetation resistant to the desert, will be our companions in the adventure, and what about the beautiful rapids!<br>
                        
                    We will have the opportunity to choose between the different types of rapids, including classes II and III, perfect for learning, either in a Kayak or on a paddle board. If what you want is to embrace the absence of technology, and breathe fresh air in the tranquility of the desert, but with plenty of water nearby, this is the right place!

                    <p class="text3">The Colorado River is a powerful master of the Rafting discipline. For lovers of this beautiful sport, solid type 4 "whitewater" skills and reliable rocking on the river are a must. In addition, it is not necessary to mention the infinite desire for adventure and adrenaline that such a beautiful river can give.<br>

                        The beautiful walls of the Grand Canyon, impetuous and full of beautiful rocks made by the Hand of the Perfect Master, will give you an incredible and rarely experienced adventure. Even if you don't have Rafting skills, you are welcome to join these rafting adventures. The security provided by our company allows the accompanying guides to offer their experience while our adventurers enjoy the warm and calm air that is only interrupted by the sound of the rapids.</p>
